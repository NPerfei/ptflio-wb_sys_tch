                <h2>The Laws of Human Nature (Robert Greene, 2018)</h2>
                <p>A comprehensive book detailing the human behavior, it draws on historical examples, psychological research, and Greene's own observations. The book explores the complex and often hidden forces that drive human actions, revealing how understanding dynamics can empower individuals to better navigate social interactions and achieve their goals. This book encourages self-awareness and empathy, that enables us to decode the behavior of others and master the art of persuasion.</p>

                    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>A comprehensive book that explores even the tiniest details. In every chapter, Greene starts off with a story about a particular historical figure. He calls these short stories "vignettes", which he uses to illustrate the theme of the current chapter. Meant to provide real-life examples, it always achieves its desired effect of highlighting the human nature he is presenting.</p>
                    <p>Next he discusses the particular nature, making references to the vignette and explaining each behavior, habit, and emotions portrayed in it. Immersing the reader on how insignificant details can be a symptom of their future behavior.</p>
                    <p>At the end, Greene provides tips or pointers on how to avoid/enhance (whether it is beneficial or not) these behaviors. Always pointing out that these are meant to improve our life.</p>
                    <p>Greene's pragmatic personality is reflected in his writing. I appreciate how he accentuates the importance of childhood in shaping a person's future habits and behaviors. Which is a very important aspect to look upon. As we may not realize that people aren't like that because they naturally have those behaviors, but because people are shaped by their experiences and interactions. People acquire and learn behaviors that reflect how they walked this world.</p>

                <h2>Psychology 2e (Openstax&#8482;, 2020)</h2>
                <p>This book is an introductory textbook geared towards individuals pursuing psychology or just people who are interested in the topic. It covers a wide range of topics, including the history of psychology, research methods, consciousness, etc.</p>

                    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Yes, this is not a fantasy or some historical fiction. It is a literal course book. But Psychology 2e is one of the books that is valuable to me. It is created by a community that offers the book and other educational resources for free, which gets 1 point from me. I have been interested in psychology for a long time, but only managing to learn concepts without proper order. This book cleared up my direction and strengthened my interest in the topic.</p>
                    <p>The book starts off with the history of psychology, how it started as part of philosophy up until how it became a formal field of study. It introduced various significant figures in the field, from Wundt and James, Skinner, Freud, up until Bandura and Piaget. Then it proceeds to discuss the process of psychological research, ethics, and approaches. The books goes through lots of topics. The activities included in every chapter also facilitates reinforcement, urging me to recall what I've learned, and at times, flipping the book back to find the answers.</p>
                    <p>The book is an introductory one though, it does not go in-depth. But it goes through a lot topics while effectively teaching you basic concepts that form a solid foundation if you want to pursue further research on the topic.</p>

                    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Demian tells the story of Emil Sinclair, a boy born in a middle-class family. He is a sensitive and introspective child, prone to anxiety as he constantly thinks about how strange the world around him is. His life changes when he meets Max Demian, a charismatic but enigmatic classmate who later on becomes a mentor and his guide.</p>
                    <p>Together with Demian, Sinclair begins to question the convential values and beliefs of his upbringing. Demian introduces him to new ways of thinking, urging him to explore himself and his true identity. Through time, Sinclair undergoes mental metamorphosis and sheds his old self to embrace a new, authentic way of living.</p>
                    <p>This story taught me about the darkness and complexity of our world. Sinclair experienced love and loss, joy and sorrow, and through it all, he continues to search for meaning and purpose in his life. Demian is about self-exploration and the importance of staying true to oneself in this world that demands conformity. And that the journey to self-discovery never ends.</p>

Through the book's portayal of Oba's fragmented perspective, the novel explores themes of alienation, self-destruction, and the masks people wear to hide their true selves.</p>
                <div class="hidden-content">
                    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>The story is told in the form of a diary, written by the protagonist, Yozo Oba, who pens his life from childhood to adulthood. Yozo feels alienated, as he struggles to make connections with others and find meaning in his life.

                    <p>Throughout the story, Yozo wonders why people do not show their true selves in front of others.

                    <p>The novel is a poignant exploration of the complexity of human nature, the impact of societal expectations on individual identity and the toll that wearing a mask can take on one's sense of self.</p>
